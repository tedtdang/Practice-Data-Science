Doctor,Reviews
"Dr. Jon Biorkman, MD","['This review is an overdue huge thank you for an extraordinary medical doctor whose care and professionalism helped me even in his absence:  I was Dr. Biorkman\'s patient while in Irvine until 2006, when I moved to N. Cal.  When I was diagnosed 7 years ago with a mass, and I feared for my life, I looked in the mirror and asked: ""When would you not be afraid?""  The answer came promptly: ""If I saw MY doctor"" (Dr. Biorkman).   So even if he does not know, he is still MY doctor - the one I always trusted,  had a professional, accurate answer with no drama, got it right every single time, and helped me stay healthy.  Having a doctor one trusts is essential.

Dr. Biorkman has been our doctor for almost 30 years. He knows our family and cares about our health. He takes his time to listen and provides thoughtful and excellent care to every member of our family. Over the years we have made sure any insurance plan we choose gives us access to Dr. Biorkman.', ""Dr. Biorkman has always, and I mean always, listened carefully to my concerns, advised me sagely, and cared about me as a person. It doesn't matter how large or small my health issue might be, he provides the same comfort and care."", 'Professionalism, empathy, listening skills, expertise, and realism  are all skills Dr Biorkman has perfected.

Dr. Biorkman has always provided great feedback to my healthcare-related inquiries and is both knowledgeable and compassionate.  He is and will always be the gold standard for how a family physician should treat patients!

Always friendly.  Listens and takes time to explain his answer in a way that is easy to understand.

Dr Biorkman is not only a very knowledgeable doctor and offers excellent advice, he is one of the most personable doctors I’ve ever had- ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!

I love Dr Biorkman and Yesenia, they are a great team. I drive 40 minutes for my appointments and never feel rushed. He is an active listener. I never feel rushed at my visit. I would highly recommend.

Dr. B had been my PCP for almost 30 years, he has always been very thorough and will spend the extra time to really understand what your concern is.

Dr. Biorkman is a gifted physician who cares deeply about his patients. When I became sick a few years back, he lined up all the specialists I needed to put me on the road to recovery, which included hospitalization for several days and follow up appointments on a regular basis. Not only did he take care of me as my primary physician, but he communicated regularly with the other professionals taking care of me. For this, I will always be grateful to Dr. Biorkman.

Dr. Biorkman is awesome! I’ve been going to him for over 20 years. He is pleasant, funny and caring. His exams are thorough and insightful. He is not the easiest to get in to see, but he’s worth it.', ""I have had doctor biorkman for many many years he's very efficient very knowledgeable and always helps me with my issues"", 'Dr. Biorkman is very thorough and listens to his patients.  I would recommend him to others.

He is A+++! Just the best! I feel very lucky to have found him. He got me to get a stress test based on this I had a triple bypass. He may have saved my life!!

I am glad that he is my primary physician again after years didn’t see him, he still the same doctor that I can trust. Thank you dr. Biorkman

Best Doctor, very concerned about your wellbeing.

I have been with Dr. B for many years.  Excellent level of detail to diagnose any issue, very personable, and gets to root cause and treatment options without feeling rushed to get pushed out his office.  His nurses have the same level of professional and personal care attitude.

A+ experience ... Extremely, knowledgeable, thorough and caring. They also set up referral specialist and follow up appointments and medications.', ""Dr. Biorkman's thorough exams, careful listening and affability make seeing this doctor an actual treat. We love him!"", 'Dr Biorkman always spends productive time with me during my appointments. In addition, he is very personable and caring.']"

"Richard McConkie, FNP-C","[""I was so pleased with the kindness and care of the staff at west valley. This was my first visit and it felt like I'd been going there forever. Dr Richard was very empathic and understanding. Listened to my issues and was a wonderful breath of fresh air in this crazy world we find ourselves in. Thank you again."", 'Excellent! Staff was helpful and considerate. Richard was amazingly kind and patient with my handicapped daughter! Would definitely recommend their office!

Office was super clean and staff was very friendly! The provider was great! I would recommend to all my friends and family.

My son and I are new patients of Dr. McConkie, at our hometown West Valley Med. Clinic in Middleton. From the moment you walk in the door they made us both feel like we were right at home, and Dr. McConkie was very thorough with addressing all of our concerns,         \n                        Thank you Dr. McConkie!

Always pleasant.  Richard does a great job and as long as he is in the Middleton Clinic, I will travel there for my appointments.

Had chronic cough for months- saw two other providers- who did nothing.  The provider was attentive, knowledgeable, and ordered treatment for me instead of just the usual-""lets wait and see- and order more tests."" This is the type of provider the medical field need more of! Absolutely would recommend to family and friends.  Office staff was very friendly and outgoing- Made going to the doctor a joy - not a chore.

My appointment was on time.  The front office staff is very nice and helpful.  Richard McConkie was exceptional.  He took the time to really listen to his patient.  He is compassionate, professional and knowledgeable.  I would not hesitate to recommend this office and staff to my family and friends.  Thanks so much for taking good care of us.

Painful procedure but helped me to feel at ease.

Always a great visit at the Middleton clinic!

Richard is amazing!!!!  He takes the time you need, listens and is compassionate.  Great ""bedside manner "" is an understatement.  He and Becky are truly an asset to Middleton\'s West Valley clinic. FIVE STARS*****

I had a UTI and I was given medication and now I feel so much better. I was very happy that it was treated immediately. Richard listened to all my concerns and also renewed my medication at the same so I did not have to come back for another appointment. I was very satisfied with the visit.

I have great confidence in Richard and would recommend him to others.', ""Love love love this doctor. He listens. He advises without being pushy. He's real. He's down to earth. He saved my husband's life literally. I wouldn't go any where else. He treats most all of our family. "", 'Totally satisfied with his care and expertise. Highly recommended. 

Great office visit. Richard is really good at listening to patient concerns first.  Never felt like he was in a hurry to get thru the visit. He made sure that if I had any questions they were answered before I left.

I would highly recommend Richard. He seems very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. ', ""Dr Richard McConkie is hands-down one of the best medical doctors I have seen in my 65 years of life! his demeanor and bed-side manner is calm, positive, thorough, attentive, flexible, and personal. I've seen him for physical check ups, a chronic lifelong condition, and other minor conditions. Richard McConkie made me feel comfortable and relaxed and asked me questions about my life (which no doctor has ever done before!). We also discussed other aging issues to address some life phase events."", 'Every time we go to the clinic we have found it a pleasant experience. From the staff up front to the nurses. Sheri lien is the greatest. Great place to go when your not feeling well

I feel that Richard listens to his patients. Is very concerned with thier healthcare. My whole family comes to this clinic to see Richard. A lot of times the same day. I would and have recommended him to other family and friends.

Been seeing him awhile. Great one on one attitude. Explains everything  you have concerns about. ']"

"Dr. Crystal Song, NMD","[""I go monthly to Dr Song to strengthen my abdomen which has a hernia caused by a botched surgery 2 years ago.  I am extremely satisfied by the high expertise and genuine care that Dr Song gives me every time as well as to my entire family. She is my only doctor and I trust her thoroughly. She's amazing in  her skills as acupuncturist and Chinese medicine/homeopathy. I recommend her highly."", 'I’ve been seeing Dr. Song for over seven years for help in treating autoimmune disease with the most natural and safe methods.  I completely trust her and feel so comfortable being in her care.  Dr. Song is very compassionate and caring, always paying close attention to the patients concerns.  I highly recommend her for adults or children.', ""I've been seeing Dr Song for the past few months for a multitude of issues. Neuropathy, spondylolisthesis (low back pain) and most recently the after effects of some elbow surgery. \n\nI've know of acupuncture for over 45 years but have always been skeptical as to its efficacy. Well, I've become a convert. In a few short visits the nerve pain and the back issues have been reduced significantly, at least 80%.  She is also treating me for post operative myofacial pain. After only 1 treatment, significant pain reduction. \n\nI would highly recommend Dr Song for any chronic pain and functionality issues you may be having.  Her knowledge, kindness and caring are very comforting. She knows what she is doing!\n\n(I'm still withholding judgement regarding the homeopathic remedies, however.  Time will tell.\n\nSterling Skouson\n\n(See your acupuncturist and your chiropractor. They can relieve pain without narcotics.)"", 'Dr Song is an excellent doctor.  My husband almost died from shigella and took a long time to recovery.  We also found out that he has 3a kidney disease.  Dr Song has been a tremendous help with the healing process and helping to improve kidney function.   She has recommended supplements along with a diet plan that is really improved his overall health.

Dr Crystal has effectively treated EVERY ailment that I brought her way.  Originally it was for my achy knees after hiking.  After monthly acupuncture treatments - I was able to hike the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim - with NO braces.  Next she helped me with my skin & digestive sensitivities.  Lastly - she has helped me monitor & control my blood pressure.  I am 64 years old & on ZERO medications.  I would highly recommend Dr Crystal to everyone!

I have been going to Dr. Song for years now and I heartily recommend her.  She is a good listener with comprehensive knowledge.  She continues to learn more and keeps an open mind.  She is unfailingly helpful and kind.  I love her office and I recommend her often!

Dr Song has figured out my gastrointestinal problem.  No other doctor has been able to figure it out.  I had been dealing with this problem for 16 plus years and she has figured it out!!!!  

Very professional & thorough ND. I would recommend her to anyone having hormonal issues ESP women over 40.

Dr. Song is one of the best doctors I have ever seen. She is quick to respond to appointment requests and messages. She takes the time to ask questions and really listens. Dr. Song knows her field and what tests to run and what to prescribe. She truly works with the patient in their care. I highly recommend her.

My health was failing despite having 3 different specialists and was on many dangerous medications. With serious diagnosis, including high blood pressure, asthma, Lupus, both rheumatoid and osteo arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome. After eliminating meds slowly and using natural health supplements I no longer have high blood pressure or irritable bowel syndrome. The regular acupuncture treatments keep my BP well under control. I trust her completely. I would recommend her highly. 

No one else has helped me as much as Dr. Song. She really gets to the root of the problem instead of just putting a Band-Aid on it. 

After a poor experience with another physician (non-naturopathic), I sought out a Naturopath.  Trusting the reviews, I decided to call Dr. Song.  I have only seen her one time...but, it is obvious that I have found the right doctor for me. She is one of the most pleasant physicians I have encountered, She is obviously interested in finding the right therapy for your situation.  And she is careful to cover the bases.  I will be starting acupuncture with her tomorrow and will write more after that', ""My husband and I have been seeing Doctor Song for a year now. We travel every month  round trip  380 miles to see her, that's how much trust we have in her to treat our health issues. We have nothing but wonderful things to say about her concern and treatment she has given us. She is determined to find solutions for our health concerns. We highly recommend her to everyone we know."", 'She is a very professional, personable naturopath. She is very confident in what she does. Everything she has done for me so far has worked. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a natural way to heal your body.']"

A caring, thorough physician. The best in the state

Dr. Ciccone is one of the best, if not THE best around. Our family has been with him for many years, following him to the Williamsburg Practice when he moved. He is both personable and professional, and genuinely cares about his patients. He is thorough and takes the time needed to make sure all concerns are addressed. His office represents everything a Family Practice should be and I would - and have -recommended him to several friends. Everyone should have a PCP like Dr. Ciccone.

Ciccone is easy to talk to and genuinely cares about his patients.

My annual physical with Dr. Ciccone went without a hitch. I will absolutely recommend Dr. Ciccone to everyone.  Whenever I go in to his office I am greeted by a very positive and wonderful staff, and by a most “patient focused” Dr. Ciccone. I have complete confidence in Dr. Ciccone and I do not hesitate to call him for advice and guidance.']"

"Dr. Natalie Peters, DNP","['Natalie really knows her stuff!  Most importantly, SHE LISTENS!  She clearly communicated her objectives only AFTER listening to my concerns.  She adheres to a “less is more” mantra.  Her practice philosophy is grounded in enhancing “naturally”....she is NOT about her clients appearing fake and overdone. She is clearly passionate about what she does and seems to love to learn (she spoke of the many continuing education/training courses she has taken as well as others she is planning on taking to learn even more advanced techniques).  Overall, I highly recommend Natalie for your esthetic needs.  I not only felt incredibly comfortable with her, but also with her well-trained and very friendly office staff (Kelly and Madi).

Dr. Natalie Peters Is very knowledgeable and very skilled.  I feel very comfortable in her care and have received amazing results.

Natalie is the best injector I have ever been treated by! She is personable, knowledgeable and so kind! I drive 4 hours to see her because her work is outstanding!

I received my first IV Vitamin Bag on Friday. I felt an immediate increase in energy and a mood lift, improved sleep, and an increased output in my workouts. I was very nervous about discomfort but I did not feel any and it was pain free. I look forward to coming back in a couple of weeks for my next treatment!

I started ""seeing"" Natalie recently. I love that she respects and appreciates my approach to easing into a new skincare routine. She is not pushy. She educates. She takes the time to understand my desires and we take it one step at a time together. I am excited with my results thus far and to see my progression! Thank you, Natalie!

Very professîonal, excellent product choice, and the scheduling is easy! The office is lovely and comfortable.

Very caring and compassionate. Even for “needle phobia” clients.

I had an amazing experience with Natalie and team. The environment is clean and welcoming from the moment you enter. Natalie takes the time to show and explain her recommendations based on what you want addressed. I entered with a budget in mind and she and her team were able to describe how to best take advantage of the monthly specials to address as much as possible within my budget without a heavy handed sales pitch. I am thrilled with my results. Natalie’s skilled precision was pain free, left me with no bruising and more importantly left me with a completely natural looking improvement.

Dr Natalie was amazing she took lots of time to listen to my concern and what I was hoping to accomplish.  Her and her staff are super attentive and caring! I highly recommenfd them!

The nurse and Karen are very personable and understanding of my weight loss needs.

I’ve been going to Karen for several years. Karen is a kind, caring, compassionate and thorough medical care provider.

I believe Karen’s thoroughness saves my life.']"

His quick actions prevented me from experiencing a heart attack.   In addition, on routine visits his professionalism, kind demeanor, and caring attitude are tremendously appreciated.
