Cal.  When I was diagnosed 7 years ago with a mass, and I feared for my life, I looked in the mirror and asked: \"When would you not be afraid?\"  The answer came promptly: \"If I saw MY doctor\" (Dr. Biorkman).   So even if he does not know, he is still MY doctor - the one I always trusted,  had a professional, accurate answer with no drama, got it right every single time, and helped me stay healthy.  Having a doctor one trusts is essential.\\n\\nDr. Biorkman has been our doctor for almost 30 years. He knows our family and cares about our health. He takes his time to listen and provides thoughtful and excellent care to every member of our family. Over the years we have made sure any insurance plan we choose gives us access to Dr. Biorkman.\\', \"Dr. Biorkman has always, and I mean always, listened carefully to my concerns, advised me sagely, and cared about me as a person. It doesn\\'t matter how large or small my health issue might be, he provides the same comfort and care.\", \\'Professionalism, empathy, listening skills, expertise, and realism  are all skills Dr Biorkman has perfected.\\n\\nDr. Biorkman has always provided great feedback to my healthcare-related inquiries and is both knowledgeable and compassionate.  He is and will always be the gold standard for how a family physician should treat patients!\\n\\nAlways friendly.  Listens and takes time to explain his answer in a way that is easy to understand.\\n\\nDr Biorkman is not only a very knowledgeable doctor and offers excellent advice, he is one of the most personable doctors I\\x92ve ever had- ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!\\n\\nI love Dr Biorkman and Yesenia, they are a great team. I drive 40 minutes for my appointments and never feel rushed. He is an active listener. I never feel rushed at my visit. I would highly recommend.\\n\\nDr. B had been my PCP for almost 30 years, he has always been very thorough and will spend the extra time to really understand what your concern is.\\n\\nDr. Biorkman is a gifted physician who cares deeply about his patients. When I became sick a few years back, he lined up all the specialists I needed to put me on the road to recovery, which included hospitalization for several days and follow up appointments on a regular basis. Not only did he take care of me as my primary physician, but he communicated regularly with the other professionals taking care of me. For this, I will always be grateful to Dr. Biorkman.\\n\\nDr. Biorkman is awesome! I\\x92ve been going to him for over 20 years. He is pleasant, funny and caring. His exams are thorough and insightful. He is not the easiest to get in to see, but he\\x92s worth it.\\', \"I have had doctor biorkman for many many years he\\'s very efficient very knowledgeable and always helps me with my issues\", \\'Dr. Biorkman is very thorough and listens to his patients.  I would recommend him to others.\\n\\nHe is A+++! Just the best! I feel very lucky to have found him. He got me to get a stress test based on this I had a triple bypass. He may have saved my life!!\\n\\nI am glad that he is my primary physician again after years didn\\x92t see him, he still the same doctor that I can trust. Thank you dr. Biorkman\\n\\nBest Doctor, very concerned about your wellbeing.\\n\\nI have been with Dr. B for many years.  Excellent level of detail to diagnose any issue, very personable, and gets to root cause and treatment options without feeling rushed to get pushed out his office.  His nurses have the same level of professional and personal care attitude.\\n\\nA+ experience ... Extremely, knowledgeable, thorough and caring. They also set up referral specialist and follow up appointments and medications.\\', \"Dr. Biorkman\\'s thorough exams, careful listening and affability make seeing this doctor an actual treat. We love him!\", \\'Dr Biorkman always spends productive time with me during my appointments. In addition, he is very personable and caring.\\']'"

Cal.  When I was diagnosed 7 years ago with a mass, and I feared for my life, I looked in the mirror and asked: \"When would you not be afraid?\"  The answer came promptly: \"If I saw MY doctor\" (Dr. Biorkman).   So even if he does not know, he is still MY doctor - the one I always trusted,  had a professional, accurate answer with no drama, got it right every single time, and helped me stay healthy.  Having a doctor one trusts is essential.\\n\\nDr. Biorkman has been our doctor for almost 30 years. He knows our family and cares about our health. He takes his time to listen and provides thoughtful and excellent care to every member of our family. Over the years we have made sure any insurance plan we choose gives us access to Dr. Biorkman., \"Dr. Biorkman has always, and I mean always, listened carefully to my concerns, advised me sagely, and cared about me as a person. It doesnt matter how large or small my health issue might be, he provides the same comfort and care.\", Professionalism, empathy, listening skills, expertise, and realism  are all skills Dr Biorkman has perfected.\\n\\nDr. Biorkman has always provided great feedback to my healthcare-related inquiries and is both knowledgeable and compassionate.  He is and will always be the gold standard for how a family physician should treat patients!\\n\\nAlways friendly.  Listens and takes time to explain his answer in a way that is easy to understand.\\n\\nDr Biorkman is not only a very knowledgeable doctor and offers excellent advice, he is one of the most personable doctors I\\x92ve ever had- ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!\\n\\nI love Dr Biorkman and Yesenia, they are a great team. I drive 40 minutes for my appointments and never feel rushed. He is an active listener. I never feel rushed at my visit. I would highly recommend.\\n\\nDr. B had been my PCP for almost 30 years, he has always been very thorough and will spend the extra time to really understand what your concern is.\\n\\nDr. Biorkman is a gifted physician who cares deeply about his patients. When I became sick a few years back, he lined up all the specialists I needed to put me on the road to recovery, which included hospitalization for several days and follow up appointments on a regular basis. Not only did he take care of me as my primary physician, but he communicated regularly with the other professionals taking care of me. For this, I will always be grateful to Dr. Biorkman.\\n\\nDr. Biorkman is awesome! I\\x92ve been going to him for over 20 years. He is pleasant, funny and caring. His exams are thorough and insightful. He is not the easiest to get in to see, but he\\x92s worth it., \"I have had doctor biorkman for many many years hes very efficient very knowledgeable and always helps me with my issues\", Dr. Biorkman is very thorough and listens to his patients.  I would recommend him to others.\\n\\nHe is A+++! Just the best! I feel very lucky to have found him. He got me to get a stress test based on this I had a triple bypass. He may have saved my life!!\\n\\nI am glad that he is my primary physician again after years didn\\x92t see him, he still the same doctor that I can trust. Thank you dr. Biorkman\\n\\nBest Doctor, very concerned about your wellbeing.\\n\\nI have been with Dr. B for many years.  Excellent level of detail to diagnose any issue, very personable, and gets to root cause and treatment options without feeling rushed to get pushed out his office.  His nurses have the same level of professional and personal care attitude.\\n\\nA+ experience ... Extremely, knowledgeable, thorough and caring. They also set up referral specialist and follow up appointments and medications., \"Dr. Biorkmans thorough exams, careful listening and affability make seeing this doctor an actual treat. We love him!\", Dr Biorkman always spends productive time with me during my appointments. In addition, he is very personable and caring.'"
