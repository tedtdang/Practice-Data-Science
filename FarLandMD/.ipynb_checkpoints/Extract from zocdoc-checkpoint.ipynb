Not only did he take care of me as my primary physician, but he communicated regularly with the other professionals taking care of me. For this, I will always be grateful to Dr. Biorkman.Dr. Biorkman is awesome! I\\x92ve been going to him for over 20 years. He is pleasant, funny and caring. His exams are thorough and insightful.
