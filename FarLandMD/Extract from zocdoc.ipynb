Dr Richard was very empathic and understanding. Listened to my issues and was a wonderful breath of fresh air in this crazy world we find ourselves in. Thank you again.\", Excellent! Staff was helpful and considerate. Richard was amazingly kind and patient with my handicapped daughter! Would definitely recommend their office!Office was super clean and staff was very friendly! The provider was great! I would recommend to all my friends and family.My son and I are new patients of Dr. McConkie, at our hometown West Valley Med. Clinic in Middleton. From the moment you walk in the door they made us both feel like we were right at home, and Dr. McConkie was very thorough with addressing all of our concerns, nThank you Dr. McConkie!Always pleasant.Richard does a great job and as long as he is in the Middleton Clinic, I will travel there for my appointments.Had chronic cough for months- saw two other providers- who did nothing.The provider was attentive, knowledgeable, and ordered treatment for me instead of just the usual-\"lets wait and see- and order more tests.\" This is the type of provider the medical field need more of! Absolutely would recommend to family and friends.Office staff was very friendly and outgoing- Made going to the doctor a joy - not a chore.My appointment was on time.The front office staff is very nice and helpful.Richard McConkie was exceptional.He took the time to really listen to his patient.He is compassionate, professional and knowledgeable.I would not hesitate to recommend this office and staff to my family and friends.Thanks so much for taking good care of us.Painful procedure but helped me to feel at ease.Always a great visit at the Middleton clinic!Richard is amazing!!!!He takes the time you need, listens and is compassionate.Great \"bedside manner \" is an understatement.He and Becky are truly an asset to Middletons West Valley clinic. FIVE STARS*****I had a UTI and I was given medication and now I feel so much better. I was very happy that it was treated immediately. Richard listened to all my concerns and also renewed my medication at the same so I did not have to come back for another appointment. I was very satisfied with the visit.I have great confidence in Richard and would recommend him to others., \"Love love love this doctor. He listens. He advises without being pushy. Hes real. Hes down to earth. He saved my husbands life literally. I wouldnt go any where else. He treats most all of our family. \", Totally satisfied with his care and expertise. Highly recommended. Great office visit. Richard is really good at listening to patient concerns first.Never felt like he was in a hurry to get thru the visit. He made sure that if I had any questions they were answered before I left.I would highly recommend Richard. He seems very knowledgeable and easy to talk to. , \"Dr Richard McConkie is hands-down one of the best medical doctors I have seen in my 65 years of life! his demeanor and bed-side manner is calm, positive, thorough, attentive, flexible, and personal. Ive seen him for physical check ups, a chronic lifelong condition, and other minor conditions. Richard McConkie made me feel comfortable and relaxed and asked me questions about my life (which no doctor has ever done before!). We also discussed other aging issues to address some life phase events.\", Every time we go to the clinic we have found it a pleasant experience. From the staff up front to the nurses. Sheri lien is the greatest. Great place to go when your not feeling wellI feel that Richard listens to his patients. Is very concerned with thier healthcare. My whole family comes to this clinic to see Richard. A lot of times the same day. I would and have recommended him to other family and friends.Been seeing him awhile. Great one on one attitude. Explains everythingyou have concerns about. '"
