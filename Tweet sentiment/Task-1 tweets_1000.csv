@tracyhutchsgt @dani_cro1 @catmomus @LedionShkembi @theearthissick @SpeakerPelosi So using your logic of not paying any attention to facts and details, Trump called #COVID 19 a \xe2\x80\x9choax\xe2\x80\x9d and seven weeks later it\xe2\x80\x99s infected 700,000+, and killed 37,000+ Americans.
We are all in deep doo doo \xf0\x9f\x8d\xb8
To be honest, everyone was scared of #coronavirus and Govt had to somehow convince the public to comply. Inflated death numbers were used to keep us at home. Regardless, the end result is what matters. Unfortunately Dems wanted this to be biblical, so they could blame Trump.

This will I fear continue as it seemed like it was a bad flu season last winter but maybe it was circulating quite a bit earlier than originally thought which has far reaching implications

@argvee @analogist_net For COVID-19, occurs to me we can't draw conclusions about different countries' ability to handle it, because of population confounders: people over 65 are (I assume) less likely to travel intl, and more likely to die from it. So intl death rate would be lower due to age skew?

@Claire___R @evan1c @JoeBiden We shall see. I was convinced Trump would lose in 2016. It is very marginal victory. There are only a few states that really determine the election with the electoral college. 45 has been poorly dealing with many of those states with COVID19 response.
