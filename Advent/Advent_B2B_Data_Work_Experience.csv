System provides real-time feedback to spine surgeons on health of nerves in proximity to spine. Surgeon can take corrective action during surgery if nerve becomes damaged.

Data store was Microsoft SQL Express and required Transact-SQL programming language. Design details documented using Unified Modeling Language (UML) with the Enterprise Architect design tool. Designed database model for application and used CSLA.NET to map data objects to database schema. Static analysis of code was carried out with PC-Lint (C/C++) and FxCop (C#) static analysis tools. Promoted and implemented test-driven software development approach using the NUnit testing framework and the TestDriven.NET development tools. Also, unit test coverage was measured using NCover. Met requirements to aquire data (up to 32 channels) in near real-time (< 500ms) for use during surgical procedures.
