Q3. Your database is an RDS instance running SQL Server with Multi-AZ replication and you have several older .NET console utilities that perform database operations every 15 seconds. When the cluster has to switch the primary database server to the secondary AZ, the .NET utilities start to report connection failures to the database although other applications are able to access the database. How do you correct this problem?
- [ ] The server running the .NET utilities is caching the DNS lookup on the database cluster address. Flush the DNS cache of the server and force the C# utilities to open new connections to the database.
- [x] The NET utilities need to change the SQL Server endpoint in the connection strings to read from the secondary database server using a try/catch.
- [ ] Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that the primary server becomes the master server again.
- [ ] A.NET application will retain the IP address of a connection string until the host machine is rebooted.

Q9. How do you architect a solution for an SQL Server database to be replicated across AWS regions in an active-active architecture?
- [ ] Use a VPN or VPC peering to establish a connection between the VPCs in each region. Install SQL Server Enterprise Edition on EC2 instances in each region and configure an Always On availability group.
- [x] Use RDS for SQL Server 2016 or 2017 Enterprise Edition. Enable Multi-AZ support and select the Mirroring/Always On option. Select another region for the mirroring option.
- [ ] You can not set up an active-active architecture for SQL Server that spans geographic regions.
- [ ] Use RDS for SQL Server and create the same instance in two different regions. Use Database Migration Service to keep each database in sync.

Q10. What does it cost to launch an EC2 instance from the AWS Marketplace?
- [ ] All images in the AWS Marketplace contain only open-source software with no additional fees and are created by other AWS users. You will pay only for the instance size you select.
- [x] Each image has its own pricing that could either be free, or include charges for software licensing costs. You will also pay for the instance the image runs on
- [ ] You can only launch images that were created by other users on your AWS account, so you pay only for the instance size you select and the S3 storage costs for the base image.
- [ ] All images in the AWS Marketplace incur additional hourly fees in addition to the charges from the instance size you select.

Q11. When using an ECS cluster with EC2 instances, what maintenance tasks should you perform on the EC2s?
- [ ] You should not directly manipulate the EC2 instances created by ECS. AWS will automatically update these instances.
- [ ] Refresh the cluster with instances built from the latest ECS AMI.
- [ ] ECS clusters do not use EC2 instances.
- [ ] The instances created by ECS do not have patches that need to be applied; however, you should make sure your containers contain any important security updates.

- [ ] Use the billing dashboard to create a cost budget. Input the max amount you want to be charged each month. Any charges that occur over this amount will cause AWS to automatically suspend those resources
- [ ] Using the root AWS account, activate IAM access to the billing information for the account. Make sure your IAM users have the Billing FullAccessGroup policy. Then from the billing dashboard, check the accrued charges once a day.
- [x] Using the root AWS account enable Billing Alerts in the user preferences. Then use CloudWatch to create a billing alarm and set a threshold to a specific dollar amount for your estimated monthly charges.
- [ ] If you are using the AWS free tier, you will have to confirm the usage of any service that goes over the AWS free tier limits.

Q15. You are creating a DynamoDB table to store all movies that have been released since 1938. Your application will allow users to search by movie title and see the details of that film. Given the sample below showing the movie data that you will be importing, what is the best set of keys to apply to this table?
- [ ] The primary key should be the title field and the partition key should be the genres field.
- [ ] The primary key should be a partition key of the title field.
- [x] The primary key should be created as a completely unique value, such a sequential numerical list of movie IDs. The partition key should be title field for fast lookup.

What is the first thing you should check?
- [ ] Check the routing tables for the VPC.
- [ ] Check the policies within Windows Firewall.
- [x] Verify that the assigned security groups allow TCP port 1433 traffic from your current IP address.
- [ ] Verify that you are connecting to the instance using a user that is not sa.

Q22. You are hosting an application configured to stream media to its clients on TCP ports 3380-3384, 3386-3388, and 3390. The Inbound tab below shows three incoming security group policies attached to this instance. Which policy should you use?
- [ ] Verify that the AWS account owners actually control the entire CIDR C block for 12.228.11.0-255 and these are secured IPs for RDP access into this instance.
- [ ] There are no recommendations to make.
- [ ] The first security group rule allows all traffic into this instance. Exposing your entire instance to the whole internet leaves the server open to various attacks of the other services running on different port numbers.
- [x] The rule that exposes TCP ports 3380-3390 would also publicly expose port 3389 (RDP) to the entire internet. Write separate rules to only expose the needed ports.

Q23. You have four front-end web servers behind a load balancer, which use NFS to access another EC2 instance that resizes and stores images for the front-end application. What security group policies should be assigned to these servers?
- [ ] Create a security group that allows inbound NFS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic from all IP addresses. Apply this group to all of the servers.
- [ ] Create a security group that allows inbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic from all IP addresses and apply this to the web servers. Create a second security group for the NFS filestore that allows outbound NFS traffic to the private IP range of the front-end web servers.
- [ ] Assign Elastic IPs to all of the instances and create a group that allows all traffic to pass between each of the five
- [x] Front-end web servers should allow HTTPS. Assign another group to all of the instances that allows all traffic to pass between instances using that group.

Q24. You have a Linux EC2 web server that suddenly is timing out on all HTTP requests and your SSH connection attempts are timing out. You notice that it is failing the system status check in the EC2 console. What action should you take?
- [ ] Reboot the instance. This will stop and start the instance and move it to another host.
- [ ] Stop and start the instance. This will move the instance to another host.
- [ ] Contact AWS support. Failing a system status check indicates a failure in the underlying hardware and must be addressed by an AWS representative.
- [x] Restore the instance from the last AMI image. System status checks indicate that the filesystem on the instance is corrupted.

Q25. You have several on-premise servers and would like to store your offsite backups on AWS. What fully managed backup service can you use to ship your backups to AWS?
- [ ] Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that the primary server becomes the master server again.
- [x] Use Storage Gateway.
- [ ] Windows Server 2016 supports S3 as a target when using storage replicas.
- [ ] Sync files directly to S3 with the AWS CLI.

Q26. What is the best practice for creating a highly available PostgreSQL database in RDS that can sustain the loss of a single AWS region?
- [ ] Verify that your instance is configured for Multi-AZ support. Database changes will be automatically synced to another region in the event of a failure and RDS will automatically select a new master until the regional failure is resolved.
- [ ] PostgreSQL cannot be replicated across regions. Restore the database backups from an S3 bucket and repoint your database connections to the new instance.
- [ ] Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. You can designate a new master database from any of the read replicas until the regional failure is resolved.
- [x] Create Read Replicas in other AWS regions. Ensure read operations against the database occur on an available Read Replica, and send write operations to another region if you need to promote a Read Replica to a standalone database if the master is down.

Q27. You created a new Linux EC2 instance and installed PostgreSQL but you are not able to establish a connection to the server from your local computer. What steps do you take to resolve this issue?
- [ ] Make sure that you are using an Elastic IP and that it is included within the `postgresql.conf` configuration file.
- [x] Verify that the assigned security groups allow traffic from your IP address to port 5432. Verify that PostgreSQL is configured to listen to external traffic and is bound to the public interface.
- [ ] Create a security group rule that allows all traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. This will verify whether or not another rule is denying the traffic.
- [ ] Stop and start the instance. New security group rules will only take effect after a restart.

Q28. A new developer has been added to the team and you have been asked to provide access to the organization's AWS account. What is the best practice for granting access?
- [x] Create a IAM user for the new developer. Assign the new developer the a developer group you already created for the other developers.
- [ ] Create a IAM user for the new developer. Manually assign policies to the new IAM user account.
- [ ] Give the new developer the IAM login that is assigned to the development team. This IAM user should already include all of the policies that a developer would need.
- [ ] Do not give the new developer access to the AWS console. Using the IAM user that is assigned to the development group, generate a new set of access keys and label these with the name of the developer.

Q29. When launching an EC2 instance with an instance type that supports instance storage, what use case is best for instance storage?
- [x] Use the instance storage to serve temporary files that require low I/O latency.
- [ ] Use the instance storage to handle files uploaded by your users. Since it is more secure than an EBS volume, you can isolate any malicious files from infecting your server.
- [ ] Instance storage is a deprecated option for storage and should not be used.
- [ ] Instance storage is faster than EBS volumes, so install the root of the operating system on this volume to speed up server performance.

Q30. What's the best practice for horizontally scaling a legacy ASP.NET web application that relies on Active Directory and is currently deployed to a single Windows EC2 instance?
- [ ] Create a clone of the server using an AMI image and user Application Load Balancer to balance the traffic between both instances using sticky sessions.
- [x] Use Sysprep to shut down the instance during a maintenance window. Create an AMI image and place both servers behind Application Load Balancer with sticky sessions.
- [ ] Launch a new EC2 with the latest version of Windows Server and install the application again. Use Application Load Balancer and sticky sessions to balance between both servers.
- [ ] Horizontal scaling is not the best practice in this situation. Increase the size of the existing EC2 instance and vertically scale the application.

Q31. You are running Docker containers on ECS. What is the most important metric to monitor?
- [ ] Monitor the EC2 service dashboard. Watch for posted outages to the ECS service.
- [x] The memory consumption of each EC2 instance in your cluster from within CloudWatch.
